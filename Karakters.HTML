    <h2>Karakters</h2>
        <h4> Captain America</h4>
        <img src="./CaptainAmericaComicVersion.webp" alt="Captain America Comic" >
        <p>During the dark days of the early 1940s, a covert U.S. Military experiment turned Steve Rogers into America's first Super-Soldier, Captain America. Throughout the war, Cap and his partner, Bucky fought alongside infantry and with a group of heroes known as the Invaders. In the closing months of World War II, Captain America and Bucky were both presumed dead in an explosion. Decades later, Captain America was found trapped in ice and revived in the modern world. Captain America would then later go on to be one of the most important members of the Avengers as well as a leader of the team.

            As a symbol of freedom and patriotism, a number of men have taken the mantle of Captain America in Rogers' various absences. Of note are William Nasland, Jeffrey Mace, Bucky Barnes, and Sam Wilson.</p>
        <h4> Shang-Chi</h4>
        <img src="./Shang-ChiComics.webp" alt="Shang-Chi Comic" >
        <p>A renowned criminal sired a child who he raised as his heir to an insidious secret society and named him Shang-Chi, the “rising and advancing of the spirit.” In a hidden, ancient fortress in China, the boy became adept at both a multitude of martial arts and philosophical disciplines, completely unaware of his father’s evil pursuits.
            As a young man, Shang-Chi found himself tasked by the society to assassinate an old enemy of his father’s, but during the mission came into contact with a venerable British secret agent named Smith. The man illuminated the society’s global criminal activities and in doing so set Shang-Chi on a path to declare war on his own father and everything he stood for.</p>
        <h4> Iron Man</h4>
        <img src="./ironmancomicart.jpeg"  alt="Iron Man Comic" >
        <p>Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating, while living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.
            Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to consult on a weapons contract overseas in enemy terrain. An improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s transport, and he was brought to the brink of death.
            Awakening as a prisoner of the warlord Wong-Chu, Tony made a gruesome discovery: the explosion had sent a piece of shrapnel mere inches from his heart. It was only the timely intervention of fellow captive and engineer Yinsen that kept the shrapnel at bay.While held captive, and forced to work on weapons, Tony turned his near-death experience into inspiration. What if he could power an iron suit that would not only keep the shrapnel from killing Tony, but also help him to escape?</p>
        <h4> Thor</h4>
        <img src="./ThorComic.webp" alt="Thor Comic" >
        <p>The very skies tremble in his presence. He commands the mystical hammer Mjolnir to protect Asgard and Earth. He is the son of Odin, Prince of Asgard. He is the God of Thunder. He is Thor.
        </p>
        <h4> Hulk</h4>
        <img src="./HulkComics.jpeg" alt="Hulk Comic" >
        <p>The child of an abusive father, Bruce Banner grew up shy and introverted, yet a scientific genius. As a young man, thanks to his standout work in the field of nuclear physics, he attracted the attention of the U.S. Army who wanted to adapt his theories for weaponry. Banner resisted such notions, but failed attempts at landing steady work convinced him to accept a position at a federal nuclear research facility at a missile base in the New Mexico desert.
            At the base, Banner was befriended by Betty Ross, daughter of General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, a man who took an instant disliking to the diminutive, passive scientist. While at the base, Banner began to develop and build a bomb that utilized a high concentration of gamma radiation, a project of high interest to an undercover foreign agent stationed there. When a teenager named Rick Jones wandered onto the test field just as Banner started the countdown for the gamma bomb’s initial test detonation, the scientist rushed out to the area to warn Jones, but the foreign agent purposefully continued the test. The bomb exploded, bathing Bruce Banner in its radiation.
            Incredibly, he survived the detonation, but later in the evening transformed into a large, grey, man-like monstrosity dubbed a “hulk” by one of the base’s soldiers.</p>
        <h4> Black Widow</h4>
        <img src="./BlackWidowComic.jpeg" alt="Black Widow Comic" >
        <p>Gifted spy Natasha Romanoff is more than worthy of her moniker, Black Widow.
            Ruthless, efficient, and exceptionally skilled, Natasha strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies. Although she once operated on the side of evil, her innate heroism allowed her to overcome her upbringing and defect, setting her on a lifelong path of redemption.</p>
        <h4> Moon Knight</h4>
        <img src="./MoonKnightComic.jpeg" alt="Moon Knight Comic" >
        <p>Born to a respectable family, but eschewing its history and beliefs Marc Spector cut his own path through life by becoming a boxer, a Marine, and finally a CIA operative. Disgusted by the organizations practices and hurt by his own brother Randall’s betrayal, Spector ejected whatever morals he still possessed and fell into mercenary work around the globe. During this dark time, he made friends with Jean-Paul “Frenchie” DuChamp, one of the only bright spots in the violent profession of a hired gun.

            Tiring of overthrowing governments and assassinations, Spector entered into the orbit of an extreme terrorist named Bushman who turned on him and left him to die in the harsh Egyptian desert. Somehow, the mercenary made it to a nearby ancient tomb and into the hands of Marlene Alaurune, the daughter of an archaeologist murdered by Bushman. Near dead, Spector rose up to find a statue of the Egyptian deity Khonshu looming over him and believed it to have saved his life. He proceeded to smash Bushman’s operations with Frenchie’s help and later realized he’d gained a new outlook on life.
            
            Spector returned to the United States with his friends and set about creating not only a costumed identity he dubbed Moon Knight, but two other personalities to aid him in his war on crime, millionaire Steven Grant and cab driver Jake Lockley. With Frenchie as his pilot, Moon Knight began to make an impression on the rest of New York City’s heroes.</p>
        <h4> Falcon</h4>
        <img src="./FalconComic.jpeg" alt="Falcon Comic" >
        <p>Sam Wilson grew up in Harlem listening to his minister father Paul deliver life-affirming sermons that instilled a sense of justice and fairness in his young self. While trying to break up a gang-related fight, Paul was killed in front of his son. Sam’s mother Darlene was later killed during a mugging, leaving him alone to raise his brother and sister.
            After living through the murders of both of his parents, young Sam embraced his father's ideals and decided to strive for goodness. Along the way he developed a talent for communicating with birds. His world travels eventually brought him to a falcon named Redwing who would become more friend than pet.
            While on the Island of the Exiles, Sam met a disguised and body-swapped Captain America who convinced him to take on the masked identity of Falcon. Not long after, Falcon became Cap’s official partner and eventually scored a winged costume. Since then, he has joined the Avengers and even temporarily took over as Captain America.</p>
